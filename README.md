# Yesh Notes
Followed steps as mentioned in https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/deploy.html
 - Basically go to **https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo**
 - Click on “Use this template” to generate a repository of your own from this template
 - Use the repository name as ~~**yeshn.github.io**~~ any repo name you want
 - This will create a new repostory with this name
 - ~~Then had to create an empty index.html file for the webpage to come up @ https://yeshn.github.io~~
 - Followed steps from **https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch**

    Publishing from a branch
    
        - Make sure the branch you want to use as your publishing source already exists in your repository.
    
        - On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.
    
        - Under your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click Settings.
        
        - In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click Pages.
    
        - Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select Deploy from a branch.
    
        - Under "Build and deployment", use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source.
    
        - Optionally, use the folder dropdown menu to select a folder for your publishing source.
    
        - Click Save.

- Your repo can now be accessed as Jupyter Lite page **https://yeshn.github.io/<repo_name>**
